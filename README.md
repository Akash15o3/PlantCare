## Overview
### Description
An app to keep a list of plants, allow users to note the date they water their plants, and remind them to the next watering cycle.
User inputs name (scientific name/nick name) and/or picture of their plants to create plants collection profile. Extra feature: We can use API to categorize the plantâ€™s species through the scientific name and automatically update the care guide (water/fertilizer) for the users.
On each plant, user can take note of the date that a plant receives water and set a reminder for an amount of time of their choice. The app will count down and remind them to water the plant again. To make this fun, the plant will show different facial expression icons such as happy face for a few days when it first gets water, worried face when it feel thirsty (some days after the water), or crying face when its watering cycle is overdue. :))
